## What is Push to Card?

Push-to-card payouts operate through existing card networks (Visa Direct and MasterCard Send) to instantly transfer funds to a cardholder's payment cards. Unlike traditional purchases where funds flow from the cardholder to the merchant, push-to-card transactions reverse this flow, sending funds from your business directly to the recipient's card.

With PayPer's integration with Visa Direct and MasterCard Send, funds are available in recipient accounts within **30 minutes** of issuer authorization.

<Note>
**What does "instant" mean?** An issuer that participates in Fast Funds must make funds available to the recipient in 30 minutes or less of approving the authorization message. The issuer increments the cardholder's open-to-buy or operating limit with the payment amount in 30 minutes or less.
</Note>

## Push to Card Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Payout Request">
    Your application calls PayPer's Payout API with sender and recipient details, including the recipient's card information
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transaction Routing">
    PayPer receives the request and routes it to the appropriate card network (Visa Direct or MasterCard Send) based on the card details
  </Step>
  <Step title="Network Processing">
    The card network processes the transaction and sends it to the recipient's issuing bank for authorization
  </Step>
  <Step title="Issuer Authorization">
    The issuing bank authorizes the transaction and makes funds available to the cardholder (typically within 30 minutes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation Response">
    PayPer receives confirmation from the network and responds to your application with transaction status and estimated posting date
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settlement & Reporting">
    End-of-day settlement and transaction reports are generated and made available through the PayPer dashboard and API
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Card Eligibility Verification

Before processing a payout, verify that the recipient's card is eligible for push-to-card transactions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Card Verification API">
    ```javascript
    const verifyCard = await fetch('https://api.payper.ca/api/v2/verify-card/', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + apiToken,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },

        card_number: '4111111111111111',
        exp_month: '12',
        exp_year: '2025'
      })
    });

    const cardInfo = await verifyCard.json();
    console.log('Card eligible:', cardInfo.eligible);

        "gig_economy_payout"
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Webhook Integration

Handle real-time payout status updates through webhooks:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Webhook Handler">
    ```javascript
    app.post('/webhooks/payout', (req, res) => {
      const { txid, status, amount, network, error_details } = req.body;
      
      switch (status) {
        case 'authorized':
          // Payout authorized by issuer - funds will be available soon
          updatePayoutStatus(txid, 'processing');
          notifyRecipient(txid, 'Funds will be available within 30 minutes');
          break;
          
        case 'completed':
          // Payout successfully delivered to card
          updatePayoutStatus(txid, 'completed');
          notifyRecipient(txid, 'Funds are now available on your card');
          break;
          
        case 'failed':
          // Payout failed - handle retry or alternative method
          updatePayoutStatus(txid, 'failed');
          handlePayoutFailure(txid, error_details);
          break;
          
        case 'returned':
          // Payout returned by issuer - card may be inactive/closed
          updatePayoutStatus(txid, 'returned');
          requestAlternativePayoutMethod(txid);
          break;
      }

## Error Handling & Best Practices

### **Common Error Scenarios**

<Accordion title="Card Not Eligible">
**Error**: Card does not support push-to-card transactions

**Solution**: 
- Use card verification API before processing
- Offer alternative payout methods (bank transfer, e-Transfer)
- Provide clear messaging to recipient about card limitations
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insufficient Merchant Balance">
**Error**: Not enough funds in merchant account to process payout

**Solution**:
- Check account balance before initiating payouts
- Implement low-balance alerts and auto-funding
- Queue payouts for processing when funds are available
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Downtime">
**Error**: Card network temporarily unavailable

**Solution**:
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitor network status pages (Visa, MasterCard)
- Provide status updates to recipients about delays
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Card Declined by Issuer">
**Error**: Issuing bank declined the payout transaction

**Solution**:
- Contact recipient to verify card status
- Suggest alternative cards or payout methods
- Retry after recipient confirms card is active
</Accordion>

### **Security Best Practices**

<Warning>
**Card Data Security**: Never store full card numbers in your systems. Use PayPer's tokenization service for repeat payouts.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Data Protection" icon="shield">
    - Encrypt card data in transit and at rest
    - Use HTTPS for all API communications  
    - Implement proper access controls
    - Regular security audits and monitoring
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fraud Prevention" icon="eye">
    - Verify recipient identity before payouts
    - Monitor for unusual payout patterns
    - Implement velocity limits and controls
    - Use device fingerprinting for web apps
  </Card>
