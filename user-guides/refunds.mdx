## Refund Validation Rules

PayPer automatically validates refund requests against several criteria:

### Transaction Eligibility
- **Transaction Status**: Original transaction must be completed
- **Age Limit**: Some payment methods have time limits for refunds
- **Amount Limit**: Refund cannot exceed original transaction amount
- **Previous Refunds**: System tracks partial refunds to prevent over-refunding

### Business Rules
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Multiple refund requests for the same transaction are handled intelligently
- **Fraud Protection**: Suspicious refund patterns are flagged for review
- **Compliance**: Refunds follow regulatory requirements for each payment method

## Error Handling

<Warning>
Always implement comprehensive error handling to manage refund failures and provide clear customer communication.

    }
  ]
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Refund Amount Exceeds Original">
**Error Code**: `AMOUNT_EXCEEDS_ORIGINAL`

      "code": "AMOUNT_EXCEEDS_ORIGINAL",
      "message": "Refund amount cannot exceed $15.00"
    }
  ]
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transaction Not Refundable">
