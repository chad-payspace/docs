## Overview

e-Transfer Payment allows your customers to make payments using Interac e-Transfer. This guide will walk you through the integration process, from initial setup to handling responses and managing the customer experience.

<Note>
  e-Transfer payments are processed asynchronously. The customer will receive an email with instructions to complete the transfer.
</Note>

## How e-Transfer Payment Works

1. **Customer initiates payment** - Customer chooses e-Transfer as payment method
2. **Your system creates payment request** - Send payment details to our API
3. **Customer receives email** - Interac sends email with transfer instructions
4. **Customer completes transfer** - Customer logs into their bank to send funds
5. **Payment confirmation** - You receive webhook notification when funds are received

## API Integration

## Out of Band Transactions

<Warning>
  Some e-Transfer payments may be processed "out of band" if there are issues with the standard flow. Monitor these transactions carefully.
</Warning>

Out of band transactions occur when:
- Customer transfers funds outside the expected workflow
- Manual intervention is required
- There are discrepancies in transfer details

### Handling Out of Band Transactions

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `transaction_id` | STRING | Unique transaction identifier |
| `status` | STRING | Current status (PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED) |
| `amount` | DECIMAL | Transaction amount |
| `customer_email` | STRING | Customer's email address |
| `reference` | STRING | Your reference ID |
| `notes` | STRING | Additional processing notes |

## Error Handling

### Common Error Codes

| Error Code | Description | Resolution |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| `invalid_email` | Customer email format is invalid | Validate email format before sending |
| `insufficient_funds` | Customer has insufficient funds | Customer needs to add funds to their account |
| `expired_transfer` | Transfer has expired | Create a new payment request |
| `duplicate_reference` | Reference ID already used | Use a unique reference for each transaction |

## Webhook Integration

### Setting Up Webhooks

Configure your webhook endpoint to receive payment status updates:

```json
{
  "event": "etransfer.payment.completed",
  "transaction_id": "et_1234567890",
  "status": "completed",
  "amount": 100.00,
  "reference": "ORDER-12345",
  "completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:45:00Z"
}
```

### Webhook Events

- `etransfer.payment.created` - Payment request created
- `etransfer.payment.completed` - Payment successfully received
- `etransfer.payment.failed` - Payment failed or expired
- `etransfer.payment.out_of_band` - Manual processing required

## Testing

### Sandbox Environment
