## Overview

e-Transfer Payout allows you to send payments to recipients via Interac e-Transfer. This guide covers the complete integration process, from setting up payouts to handling responses and managing recipient experiences.

<Note>
  e-Transfer payouts are processed asynchronously. Recipients will receive an email with instructions to accept the transfer.
</Note>

## How e-Transfer Payout Works

1. **Initiate payout request** - Your system sends payout details to our API
2. **Payout processing** - We validate and process the payout request
3. **Recipient notification** - Recipient receives email with transfer details
4. **Recipient accepts transfer** - Recipient logs into their bank to accept funds
5. **Payout confirmation** - You receive webhook notification when funds are accepted

## Security & Compliance

### Security Questions

<Tip>
  While security questions are optional, they add an extra layer of security to your payouts and are recommended for larger amounts.
</Tip>

Best practices for security questions:
- Use questions only the recipient would know
- Avoid easily guessable answers
- Consider using multiple security questions for high-value payouts

### Auto-Deposit

When `auto_deposit` is enabled:
- Recipients with compatible banks can receive funds automatically
- No security question needed for auto-deposit
- Faster processing times
- Enhanced recipient experience

## Webhook Integration

### Webhook Events

Configure your webhook endpoint to receive payout status updates:

```json
{
  "event": "etransfer.payout.completed",
  "transaction_id": "etp_9876543210",
  "status": "completed",
  "amount": 250.00,
  "recipient_email": "recipient@example.com",
  "reference": "PAYOUT-67890",
  "completed_at": "2024-01-20T16:45:00Z"
}
```

### Available Webhook Events

- `etransfer.payout.created` - Payout request created
- `etransfer.payout.sent` - Email sent to recipient
- `etransfer.payout.completed` - Recipient accepted the transfer
- `etransfer.payout.expired` - Transfer expired without acceptance
