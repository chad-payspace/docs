## API Authentication

All API requests to Paybilt's endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token. This token must be included in the Authorization header of every request.

### Authentication Header

Include the following header in all API requests:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

### Example Request

Here's an example of how to make an authenticated request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.paybilt.com/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

### Token Generator

<Note>
  This is a demo token generator. In production, you should generate tokens through your secure backend.
</Note>

<TokenGenerator />

### Token Security

<Warning>
  Keep your tokens secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

- Tokens should be stored securely in environment variables or a secure key management system
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Use different tokens for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Never commit tokens to version control

### Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive one of these error responses:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "Invalid or missing authentication token"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "forbidden",
    "message": "Token has expired or been revoked"
  }
}
```
