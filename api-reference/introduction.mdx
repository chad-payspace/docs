    **Learn concepts, see examples, and follow tutorials**
    
    - Step-by-step integration guides
    - Interactive API testers
    - Real-world implementation examples
    - Best practices and troubleshooting
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Reference" icon="code" href="/api-reference">
    **Detailed endpoint documentation and specifications**
    
    - Complete endpoint specifications
    - Request/response schemas
    - Parameter definitions
    - Error code reference
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to Use This Documentation

### ðŸš€ **If you're just getting started:**
1. Start with [Getting Started](/user-guides/getting-started) to understand PayPer's capabilities
2. Set up [Authentication](/user-guides/authentication) to secure your API calls
3. Choose your integration approach from [Payment Types](/user-guides/payments)

### ðŸ›  **If you're implementing:**
1. Follow the relevant User Guide for your payment method
2. Use the interactive API testers to validate your integration
3. Reference the API documentation for complete parameter details
4. Test in sandbox before going live

### ðŸ”§ **If you're troubleshooting:**
1. Check error handling sections in the User Guides
2. Review webhook integration patterns
3. Consult the API Reference for specific error codes
4. Use sandbox testing scenarios

## Interactive Features

Our documentation includes several interactive features to accelerate your development:

<Accordion title="Live API Testing">
Many User Guides include **interactive API testers** that let you:
- Test real API endpoints directly in the documentation
- Generate RSA keys for encryption
- Encrypt sensitive data client-side
- See real request/response examples

*Perfect for prototyping and validation before coding.*
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multi-Language Examples">
Code examples are provided in multiple languages:
- **cURL** for quick testing
- **Node.js** for JavaScript developers  
- **Python** for Python developers
- **PHP** for PHP developers

*Copy and paste examples to jumpstart your integration.*
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Comprehensive Error Handling">
Every guide includes:
- Common error scenarios and solutions
- Validation rules and requirements
- Debugging tips and best practices
- Sandbox testing approaches

*Reduce development time by avoiding common pitfalls.*
</Accordion>
