## API Overview

Our REST API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing payments, transactions, and account operations. All endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

<Note>
  All API requests must include your API key in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
